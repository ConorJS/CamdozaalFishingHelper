# Camdozaal Fishing Helper
Provides a simple overlay and useful alerts for Camdozaal fishing/prayer, to help make this easier to AFK. This is useful for F2P players looking to train prayer with minimal difficulty/focus.

The plugin highlights the correct bench to use based on which fish you have and what state they are in (processed or otherwise), alerts the player by adding a visual glow effect to the window when a resource is nearly depleted and shows visual progress indicators of how many of each resource remains, which convey how much time the player has before they have to interact again.

The game window will glow a color (configurable). You can also configure the speed of
the glow effect, and how long your character needs to stand still for the
alert to trigger. This is separate from RuneLite's built-in alerts, as these are designed to be less harsh, and therefore more tolerable given this activity's frequent alerts.
